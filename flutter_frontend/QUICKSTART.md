# Flutter Frontend Quick Start Guide

Get the Beauty LMS Flutter app running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites Check

```bash
# Check if Flutter is installed
flutter --version

# If not installed, follow: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
```

## Quick Setup

### 1. Navigate to Flutter Project

```bash
cd flutter_frontend
```

### 2. Get Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Start Backend (in another terminal)

```bash
cd ../backend
npm install  # if not already done
npm start
```

The backend should be running on `http://localhost:3000`

### 4. Run Flutter App

Choose your platform:

**Web (Recommended for testing)**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Android**
```bash
flutter run -d android
```

**iOS (macOS only)**
```bash
flutter run -d ios
```

## First Time Setup

If this is your first time running Flutter, you may need to:

1. **Accept licenses** (Android)
   ```bash
   flutter doctor --android-licenses
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (check with flutter doctor)
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

3. **Enable web** (if needed)
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   ```

## Testing the App

### 1. Check Connection
- Open the app
- Look for green indicator showing "Connected to Backend"
- If red, make sure backend is running

### 2. View Live Courses
- You should see the list of courses on the main screen
- Each course shows status (scheduled/active/completed)

### 3. Start a Course as Host
- Click "Host" button on any course
- You'll be taken to the meeting room
- Camera and microphone will be requested

### 4. Join as Participant (Test with 2 devices/windows)
- In another window/device, use "Join Meeting" tab
- Enter the 6-digit meeting code from the host session
- Enter your name and click "Join Meeting"

### 5. Try Features
- **Chat**: Type messages in the chat panel
- **Audio**: Click microphone icon to mute/unmute
- **Video**: Click camera icon to enable/disable video
- **Participants**: See who's in the meeting
- **Leave**: Click "Leave" button to exit

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Connected
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Should return: {"status":"OK",...}
```

### Camera/Microphone Not Working
- **Web**: Grant permissions in browser
- **Android**: Grant permissions in app settings
- **iOS**: Grant permissions in app settings

### Dependencies Error
```bash
# Clean and reinstall
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Build Error
```bash
# Check Flutter installation
flutter doctor -v

# Update Flutter
flutter upgrade
```
