## Configuration

### API Endpoint

The API endpoint is configured in `lib/services/api_service.dart`:

```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/api';
```

For production or different environments, update this URL accordingly.

### Socket.IO Connection

The Socket.IO connection is configured in `lib/services/socket_service.dart`:

```dart
_socket = IO.io('http://localhost:3000', <String, dynamic>{
  'transports': ['websocket'],
  'autoConnect': false,
});
```

## Dependencies

Key dependencies used in this project:

- `flutter_webrtc`: ^0.9.48 - WebRTC support for video conferencing
- `socket_io_client`: ^2.0.3+1 - Socket.IO client for real-time communication
- `http`: ^1.1.0 - HTTP client for API calls
- `provider`: ^6.1.1 - State management (if needed)
- `intl`: ^0.18.1 - Internationalization and date formatting

## Building for Production

### Web

```bash
flutter build web
```

The build output will be in `build/web/`.

### Android

```bash
flutter build apk
# or for app bundle
flutter build appbundle
```

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios
```

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues

1. Ensure the backend is running:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Check the backend health:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   ```

3. Verify the API endpoint in the Flutter app matches your backend URL.

### WebRTC Issues

1. For web, ensure you're using HTTPS or localhost (required for camera/microphone access)
2. Check browser permissions for camera and microphone
3. On mobile, ensure app permissions are granted

### Dependencies Issues

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade
```

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Models: Add new data models in `lib/models/`
2. Services: Add new API endpoints in `lib/services/api_service.dart`
3. Screens: Create new screens in `lib/screens/`
4. Widgets: Create reusable widgets in `lib/widgets/`

### Running Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

## Contributing

When contributing to the Flutter frontend:

1. Follow Flutter best practices
2. Use meaningful widget and variable names
3. Add comments for complex logic
4. Test on multiple platforms before submitting
5. Ensure code formatting: `flutter format .`
6. Run analysis: `flutter analyze`
